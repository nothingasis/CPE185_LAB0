Lab 0 Aruduino:

Part 1:

The input voltage to the circuit: MAX 4.52V MIN: 20.7mV 
The max voltage is from 1.146V - (-3.432)
**Had a huge problem with compatibility... ANALOG discovery was being super picky with what computer
found out it was a power issue on the usb ports **

When we moved the solid orange(Positive on channel 1) to the anode side of the LED
    MIN: .16V   MAX: .22V

Page 16:
    MAX: 1.125V AVG: 1.128V
    MIN: 1.339V AVG: 3.01V
    Frequency: 666Hz

Orange LEAD to ANODE:
    MAX: 2.66mV AVG: 2.66mV
    MIN: 1.339mV AVG: 1.339mV
    Frequency: 0Hz
