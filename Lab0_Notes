Lab 0 Aruduino:

Part 1:

The input voltage to the circuit: MAX 4.52V MIN: 20.7mV 
The max voltage is from 1.146V - (-3.432)
**Had a huge problem with compatibility... ANALOG discovery was being super picky with what computer
found out it was a power issue on the usb ports **

When we moved the solid orange(Positive on channel 1) to the anode side of the LED
    MIN: .16V   MAX: .22V

Page 16:
    MAX: 1.125V AVG: 1.128V
    MIN: 1.339V AVG: 3.01V
    Frequency: 666Hz

Orange LEAD to ANODE:
    MAX: 2.66mV AVG: 2.66mV
    MIN: 1.339mV AVG: 1.339mV
    Frequency: 0Hz

Push Button Circuit:
    We were able to follow a circuit diagram to get the push button started
    Now just trying to figure out ho tie it to PIN13.
    got it to work see code and images

Part 2:
    Arbitrary Wave Generator:
        Made the connections and got a sin wave.
        The only thing to question is why our sine wave has a vertical offset of -0.1.
            Fixed the offset issue. For whatever reason we were given an offset of 1V but had to change it to a 
            1.2V offset. This was seen as well when we did a serial plotter.

    analogRead():
        Wave1 and Channel 1 (positive) on a single rail and we took another wire
        from the same rail and fed it into the receiving end of the arduino.
        That gets passed into analogRead() where the value is stored in sensorvalue.
        It then gets read out via serial with a delay of 1ms.

        Got it work, when we tried to slow it down, it would skip numbers. Seems like th reason for this
        is because the delay only delays what we have running but the actual iteration of 0 to 1023
        continues to run even with the delays. Hence they are not connected with each other.
    
    Serial Plotter:
        Initially with a 1V offset we were getting the bottom fo our waveform cutoff.
        After we changed the offset to 1.2V we were getting the full wave without any cutoff.

    Play with another wave type in AWG:
        We played with a sin wave(default) and we changed it to a square wave.
        We got a clean signal. But did see "white noise" at the top and bottom of square wave.
Part 3:
    AnalogInOutSerial:
        We finished the PWm portion of the lab.
        We had to spend some time figuring out what the pwm essential is.
        But we learned by reading through the lab that it's a simple conversion from
        digital to analog.
Part 4: Motor
    We were able to borrow a motor from the activity bot.
    Having trouble understanding what the delay() function actually does. Does it keep the previous function running for that delayed parameter? Or does it stop
    for that amount of time passed into delay()?
